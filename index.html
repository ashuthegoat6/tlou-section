        About Me
      </h3>
      <p style="font-family: Work Sans; text-align: center; width: 90%; font-size: 25px; margin-left: 5%;">
        I am a Punjabi Digital Artist from Canada. I've been doing digital art for around 3 years, since the pandemics beginning. I picked up digital art as a hobby to express my love for my favorite series. For context, Adventure Time is one of my favorite shows and it was the main reason to why I learned digital art. I'd constantly see amazing artwork of the characters and it had peeked my interest. I now draw my own characters (OC), album covers, my favorite shows and games as well as commission work.

        Another thing about is me is I really enjoy interior decorating rooms. As you can see this is my PC setup, I've spent a lot of time and a lot of money creating my perfect setup that incapsulates my interests and favorite hobbies, including using my drawing pad as a second monitor. I also plan to decorate my aunts tailoring shop as well as my older cousins home (as soon as she buys it)
        <br>
        If we get a new house, I'm also planning on decorating the kitchen with different lights, specfically stripe lights,

          The Last Of Us
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%;font-family: Work Sans; text-align: center; width: 90%; font-size: 20px; color: #b8b8b8;">
          The Last Of Us is one of my favorite game series of all time. The Last Of Us is the first game where the characters look, feel, and act like humans and it's kind of a double edged blade for me. I've never really grasped the idea of how awful war can be with guns involved because, obviously, I've never seen anybody get shot. I've played dozens of shooters and watched dozens of violent movies involving guns and they've never really phased me until I played this game. This game is grounded to reality, to the way people react to watching their friends get shot in the face, to the physics of bodies of how they react to getting shot, the sounds of death that cry from fallen enemies. I often find it scary because it gives the most accurate insight to how scary war can be.
          <br><br>
          The Last Of Us also has some of my favorite characters in media, characters like Ellie, Abby, Joel and Henry are some of the most realistic characters I've seen. These characters are like intricate spider-webs full of their own thoughts and opinions and it's a challenge to try to decipher and unravel these characters.

            Durarara is a show I've fell in love with recently, it's easily my favorite anime with a unique cast of characters that all intersect 	with each other. At the top of my page, you can see an artwork I created of Celty Sturluson, one of the many main characters of 	the show. Her design, her voice actress and her personality is what made me find her such a cool character. She's never oversexualized like what most Animes do. Not only that, but many other characters have an amazing dynamic, such as Anri and Celty, Shizuo and Izaya and Shizuo and Celty. This wide web of characters that interact with each other in so many different ways makes the world of Durarara feel alive.
          <br><br>
         I'll catch myself rewatching multiple times, I've even read a lot of the manga for it, (which is way cooler than the show)

          Adventure Time
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 6%; text-align: center; width: 90%; font-size: 125%;font-family: Work Sans;color: white;">
          Adventure Time is a show that I hold very close to my heart. It's easily my favorite cartoon show one of my favorite shows of all time. A big part of why I love Adventure Time so much is because all of the characters, the episodes and plotlines are so likable and enjoyable. Each episode slowly builds on characters backstories and lore just like how Durarara does but at a greater extent. On top of all of that, I grew up with this show. As Finn grew older and learned lessons, I learned them right by his side. By the time the episode "Seventeen" came out, I was 17 myself. It felt like Finn and Jake were my siblings growing up.
          <br><br>
          Without this show I don't think I'd be the same person I would be. It's been so vital to my childhood and shaping me into the person I've became.
